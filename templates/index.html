<p>Welcome to my simulation of Risk die results.</p>
<p>Below you will be able to fill in a number of options and run a number of simulations based on the Risk board game.</p>
<p>The goal was to see how much the Monte Carlo simulation results overlapped with the intuition built up from years of playing the game with family.</p>
