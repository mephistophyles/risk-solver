    <h2>Risky Business</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Some families play monopoly to create some added tension during the holidays, my family played Risk.
        We also had the house rule that defenders could choose how many dice they could roll (up to 3), based on the roll of the attacking player.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below you will be able to select the house rules of your own and run a number of simulations.
        The goal was to see how much the Monte Carlo simulation results overlapped with the intuition built up from years of playing the game with family.
