### Risk-solver

This is a quick and dirty demonstration of how to create a Flask-based API for a Python simulation.

The write-up will be on https://philheijkoop.com

### Flask

Currently the app will handle both user input from an html form, or will run a simulation based on the url (the site's main address/a/b/c/ where a is the amount of simulations to run, b is the attacking army size and c is the defending army size), refreshing that page will generate a new run.

### Frontend

Currently the page has bootstrap available to render the form, but there hasn't been any CSS added (yet).
